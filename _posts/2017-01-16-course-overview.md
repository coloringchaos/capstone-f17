Although you may look at this document and think [tl;dr](), ***read the whole thing***! I’ve thought carefully about  all of this, and have worked hard to give you both independence and support throughout your Capstone process. The rationales, requirements, milestones and consequences are clearly stated in this document.

<br>

#### Group Meetings
The time reserved for all Capstone classes, workshops, critiques, and activities is <span class="underlined">**Wednesday from 12:00-4:15pm**</span>. This time will be used for lectures, group exercises, critiques, discussions, one-on-one checkins and more. Often times, this class period will be used for individual work time, but <span class="underlined">**it is mandatory that you attend class for the full duration of this Wednesday session**</span>. Every single week you should be prepared with something to work on during class.

If you take advantage of the time and space well, you ought to be able to do most of your Capstone work during the scheduled meeting times. Remember, Capstone is just one class. It is not meant to take over and ruin every other aspect of your life. A major objective of this process is for you to learn how to budget and schedule your time and energies over a long term project and still have a life (i.e. sleep, go to a movie, have a relationship).

#### One-on-one Meetings
Part of the time on Wednesdays will be reserved for one-one-one meetings with your Instructor. You are also encouraged to set up additional individual appointment as needed.  

Book meeting time on my [Capstone-only Appointment Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUdLc0ZFRlNQWkYyfGRlZmF1bHR8M2ExNGRiNzQ3ZTk1NWE3NDQzMmFjZTZjNWQxYzRlMTA)

There are also appointments on my [Office Hours Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUZYbEdENFRMME1vfGRlZmF1bHR8NmNhMjk2MzA1MTExOTU0ZDI4N2VlNDUzMDRiOGU4Y2I)

If you can't find a time that works, please email your Instructor to schedule something.

<br>

# Attendance

I take attendance extremely seriously - and because we only meet once each week, it is absolutely mandatory that you are present and prepared for each class. **Missing more than 2 Wednesday classes is a cause for failure.**

Critiques are a very important part of the design process, and I take them seriously. Even if your project is not fully completed, it is absolutely mandatory that you attend every critique and provide feedback on your classmates' projects. It will affect your grade negatively (drop one letter grade) if you do not show up for critique (this includes both days if the critique runs longer than one class period). Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need uploaded, tested and ready. Student computers must be shut off and full participation is expected.

<!-- # Progress & Major Milestones

Although your Capstone project is mostly self-directed, there will be weekly assignments and mandatory milestones to be met. Here are the major milestones that you all have at the same time:

|---|---|---|
|  <span class="underlined">*February 9, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Project Proposal / Approval  |
|  <span class="underlined">*February 22, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Project Set (no changing topics after this date…)  |
|  <span class="underlined">*March 8 & 15, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Midterm Presentation  |
|  <span class="underlined">*May 5, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Final Presentation (to faculty and guests)  |



*The major purpose of a milestone is to make sure you are on track. And they have consequences:*

+ If your proposal is not accepted, you cannot proceed until it is.

+ If the feedback at Midterm Reviews is that there is little evidence of worthy work, or progress, or an evaluation by your Advisor and the Reviewers that you will not be able to complete a substantive, acceptable thesis project–then you will be notified that you will fail. That means you will need to re-take Capstone (which would potentially postpone your graduation). Read this one again now, please!

+ If, at the Final Presentation (that is, the last class), you do not have a demonstrably accomplished project, show little progress, and in other ways do not meet the requirements of a Capstone project, you will fail and be required to re-take Capstone. Don’t get to this point: your parents may be on the plane to come celebrate with you.

Because each of you has a different project, with different internal timelines and needs, after your proposal is accepted, you will make up your own production schedule and assignments. I may make additional assignments or require additional readings for you as well. Essentially the assignment every week is **[Advance Your Project (AYP)]()**. That is, an assignment may say ‘prepare a presentation’, and you must do that, but don’t stop working on your actual project: AYP!

<br> -->

# Assignments

Part of the idea of Capstone is to both give you a lot of support and a lot of independence. The emphasis of this course is in project development, and every week you will receive an evaluation of your progress.

Each week, together with your instructor, you will set goals for the upcoming week. You will be evaluated on how successfully you achieve these determined objectives. For the first 13 weeks of the semester (not including the week of fall break), you will receive up to 50 pts for the progress that you made that week. This score will consider not only the individual progress that you made on your project, but also includes attendance, participation, and engagement in class. The final weeks of the semester will be dedicated to documentation and presentation preparation.

#### Every week = Advance Your Project (AYP!)

<br>

# Evaluation

|---|---|---|
|Weekly Progress (13 weeks x 50 pts) | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 650 pts |
|Final Documentation (video or website) 		| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 100 pts |
|Final Presentation | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 100 pts |
|Final Production Project | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 150 pts |

You must earn at least a C in order to receive TAM credit for this course.

# Documentation

There are two distinct aspects to the documentation requirement in this course:

#### Online Journal / Work-in-progress Blog

Ongoing documentation of your research, your design and production processes, testing, and methodology is a major part of your final Capstone project and serves in lieu of a lengthy written paper. Post a summary of your week’s progress on the blog regularly as the semester progresses. Your weekly posts should include images, drawings, graphics, code snippets, videos, etc. in addition to a written description of your work.

Your Blog will be a record of your process during the semester and open for insights and feedback from your advisors, mentors and classmates as you develop your project. It is intended to be a resource for *YOU* – a record and reflection of your process, your thinking, your insights. I promise you it will be useful for you to look back on!! I expect you to spend careful time cultivating this online journal, logging ideas and notes. Each post does not need to be especially formal, it should, however, be thorough.


#### Final Project Documentation

By the end of the semester, you must comprehensively document your project online. The purpose of this is to have your work available online in a format that you can share with others (including future employers, educators, press, etc.) Your final documentation must take one of two forms, or both!

1. <span class="underlined">**Project Video**</span> (posted on Vimeo)

2. <span class="underlined">**Project Website**</span>

It should be obvious which format is most appropriate for your project (often a video is best for highly interactive or experiential works). If you are unsure which format is most appropriate, discuss it with your Instructor.

<br>

# Mentors / Consultants / Feedback

During your Capstone 2 semester, you must have two experts review your project. One can be an ATLAS or CU faculty member (someone other than your Instructor), and one must be someone ***outside*** of CU - ideally someone who is an expert in the industry or field that your project is targeting. The purpose of these expert consultations is to receive an additional perspective on your work. If there is someone particular that you would like to be connected with, let me know - I may know that person or have a contact for them. Or contact them on your own. People love to talk to students!

#### *VERY IMPORTANT: Keep track of all feedback!*

Take notes during meetings with your experts, and document your reflections to your blog. Additionally, be sure to write down what you hear in your class critiques as a post. It is a very useful part of the design process. When you are presenting in class, a classmate can take notes for you so that you can concentrate on the crit.

<!-- You will get a lot of feedback during the mid-term reviews both orally and in written form. We will go over that feedback together carefully and discuss how you will (or will not) incorporate their ideas. You will post a summary of those decisions to your blog. -->

# Project Requirements

+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of research**</span>. This includes knowing the field, alternative, previous and current approaches, your audience, how is your project different from other similar things, what are your influences.
+ <span class="underlined">**Cite your research sources.**</span> Wikipedia is kind of a starter resource, a pointer to more primary sources, which you need to seek out and cite. Develop a list of books/articles to read, inspirational projects, experimental work, installations to see, etc.
+ <span class="underlined">**Plagiarism…not allowed!**</span> Be sure to cite the sources of your research. That includes code. For example, if you have dropped in some code from Tom Igoe’s book or class, cite that too. Using work without attribution is not just stealing, it’s leaving the impression that you did all the work.
+ <span class="underlined">**Process documentation on your Capstone Journal throughout**</span>. At a minimum, you must write one post per week.
+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of user testing and feedback**</span> once the idea is far enough along to solicit meaningful feedback.
+ <span class="underlined">**Consideration of user experience.**</span> At the end of the semester, you must be able to show a demonstration prototype that incorporates lessions learned through user test the project multiple times throughout the semester.
+ <span class="underlined">**Any outside help must be approved in advance.**</span> This includes material assistance on the development of your project outside of class (i.e. design, programming, production). If you need support for an element or two, that’s ok…but at least 80% of the work must be your own.
