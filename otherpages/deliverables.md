## Presentation

This presentation is an opportunity for you to share what you have created and receive feedback and critique from the larger TAM community. In this presentation, you must clearly communicate the question / goal (the why, the purpose) of your project and defend your process in working towards this objective. You should also discuss precedents that inspired or informed your work, and identify what is unique about your idea or your approach. Somewhere towards the beginning of your presentation, be sure to state your question or goal in this project clearly and succinctly! *“I was curious how…”*

Most of all, think of your presentation as a <span class="underlined">**story**</span>. And to make it engaging for the audience, you need to bring them with you. Talk about the moments of insight or discovery, as well as roadblocks and challenges that you faced.  

#### ***The key to a strong presentation is PRACTICE!***

<br>

#### Things to Avoid

+ Apologizing
+ Live demos - videos / animations are a more concise way to demonstrate what you made!
+ Poor image or video quality
+ Too much text on your slides
+ Reading your slides
+ Technical jargon

<br>

A few resources that might be helpful in crafting your talk:

+ Here’s a great talk about <span class="underlined">[the secret structure of great talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks)</span>
+ Also be conscious of how you present yourself! <br><span class="underlined">[Your body language shapes who you are!](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are)</span>


Your presentation should be a <span class="underlined">**7 minutes long**</span><br>

<!-- ## Precedents / References

<span class="underlined">*Capstone 1 Only*</span>

You should submit a minimum of 3 precedents, or references of work that have inspired you in this process. This could be work that is similar to yours. It could be an example of something that works really well, or an example of something that you are aiming to improve or reimagine. A precedent could also be technology that has enabled your work; or it might be a significant person or event who inspired your why.

Reflect on your process this semester, and consider the most significant influences. These are your precedents. If you’re not sure if something counts as a precedent, talk to me about it!!!

For each precedent, you must write a description of what it is and how it informs your work.

If you have a longer collection of resources that you have utilized throughout your process, you must also cite these sources as part of your deliverables.

## Process Writeup

<span class="underlined">*Capstone 1 Only*</span>

For everyone in Capstone 1, you must submit a 500-750 word writeup of your work this semester.

You should describe what you did this semester, and, more importantly, what you have learned from the process. Communicate your why, and outline your steps for the future. This is essentially a more concise, written version of your presentation. Do not focus on your research or precedents here, this is where you talk about your project.

This writeup is an opportunity to reflect on the work you have done this semester, and set an intention for what you intend to produce next semester in Capstone 2.

## Online Documentation

This can be in the format of your choice, but ***it must live online***. For the vast majority of you, a project video will make the most sense. You might also choose to make a dedicated project website, or post your project on instructables or github as a tutorial.

The intention with this is to create ONE place that concisely summarizes what you have worked on this semester. It should be comprehensive, but should not be so long that you lose the attention of a viewer. You can link to older posts that you have on your blog, and also include links to references and precedents. And utilize as much media as possible (screen shots, process videos, sketches, etc..). This online documentation can include some version of your precedent and process writeups (that you turned in at the end of last semester).

Think about FULLY documenting your project in such a way that you could share this detailed documentation with a potential employer or as a quality reference of your creative work.

Post your final documentation to your blog with a Process Writeup, 500-750 words that explain what you created. You should describe what you did this semester, and, more importantly, what you have learned from the process. Communicate your why, and outline your steps for the future. This is essentially a more concise, written version of your presentation. Do not focus on your research or precedents here, this is where you only talk about your project.

## Self Evaluation

Write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on your own performance this semester. What went smoothly for you, and what was challenging? Overall, how do you feel about the work you produced? What grade do you feel you should earn for your work this semester and why?

Send this self evaluation and a link to your online documentation to me <br> <span class="underlined">**Wednesday, December 20th by midnight**</span>
